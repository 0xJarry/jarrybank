# Jarry Bank
**use context7 MCP tool to lookup docs for the technologies used in the app**
> Simple Next-JS Web3 App to view connected wallets tokens.
> Monorep Design, for Website and API, and leave room for other things.
> Everything must be built modularly with the concept of expanding easily
> Implement for Avalanche Block Chain but keep in mind the modularity, this will be expanded
> For Web3: Use Wagmi, Viem, Rainbow Wallet and all their requirements
> Use UI use shadcn
> For price APIs use Moralis and Coinmarketcap
> For RPCs use alchemy and infura
> Web app will be on vercel
> Would like to use Vercel for the API deployment.
> GH Actions will control all deployments, ex Vercel will not build itself when repo updates.
> Everything should be built as simply as possible - i want to get the simpliest version created and everything connected (API service, etc) before creating overly complex CI/Test pipelines.
> Documentation should be very clear for me and the developer when the user must take action - like create env variables, where they should be (in code or on other app)

## UI
> Header with "Jarry Bank" on the left, and a connect wallet button on the right
> Center / main screen has a simple box showing a table of token name, quantity, price, and value
> I like this color pallete [text](.ui/color-pallete.css)
