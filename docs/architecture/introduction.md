# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **JarryBank**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Analysis

Based on your requirements for a Next.js Web3 monorepo with Vercel deployment, I recommend considering:

1. **T3 Stack** - Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Tailwind CSS (perfect base for Web3 apps)
2. **Turborepo starter** - Optimized monorepo with Next.js apps and shared packages
3. **Vercel Next.js templates** - Pre-configured for Vercel deployment

**Decision**: I recommend starting with a **Turborepo + Next.js** setup as it provides the monorepo structure you need while being easily deployable to Vercel.
