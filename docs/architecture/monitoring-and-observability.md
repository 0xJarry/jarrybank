# Monitoring and Observability

## **Monitoring Stack**
- **Frontend Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for Core Web Vitals, user interactions, and performance metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Vercel Function Logs for API performance, error rates, and execution metrics  
- **Error Tracking:** Built-in error boundaries with console logging, future Sentry integration planned
- **Performance Monitoring:** Vercel Speed Insights for real user monitoring and synthetic testing

## **Key Metrics**

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- JavaScript errors and unhandled promise rejections
- API response times from client perspective
- User interactions (wallet connections, token refreshes, navigation)

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate per API endpoint
- Error rate by endpoint and error type
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance (when implemented)
- External API dependency health and latency
