## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundation story.

### Tech Stack Requirements
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js ^15.1.8 (stable) with App Router [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]
- **Language**: TypeScript ^5.6.0 for type safety [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ^4.0.0-beta (⚠️ BETA VERSION - requires special installation) with v4 performance improvements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#css-framework]
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui latest with copy-paste component system [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- **Package Manager**: pnpm ^9.0.0 for efficient monorepo management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#package-manager]
- **Build Tool**: Turborepo ^2.3.0 for monorepo orchestration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#monorepo-tool]
- **Deployment**: Vercel Latest for edge deployment [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#deployment]

### Project Structure
Based on unified-project-structure.md, the project follows a monorepo structure:
- `apps/web/` - Main Next.js application [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps]
- `packages/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#packages]
- `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#packages]
- `packages/web3/` - Web3-specific utilities [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#packages]
- Root level workspace configuration with pnpm-workspace.yaml [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#root]

### File Locations
- Main application: `apps/web/src/app/` (App Router structure) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps/web]
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#components]
- Configuration files: Root level (package.json, turbo.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#root]
- TypeScript config: `apps/web/tsconfig.json` and root `tsconfig.json` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#configuration]

### Coding Standards
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript ^5.6.0 with strict mode [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks, kebab-case for files [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest ^2.1.0 for both frontend and backend testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/tests/` directory structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Setup**: Test environment setup in `apps/web/tests/setup.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use exact versions specified in tech-stack.md
- Follow monorepo structure exactly as defined in unified-project-structure.md
- All configuration must align with Vercel deployment requirements
- Environment setup must support both development and production builds

### Risk Mitigation - Beta Version Considerations

#### ⚠️ Tailwind CSS 4.0 Beta Risks
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Issue:** Tailwind CSS 4.0 is currently in beta with breaking changes from v3.x
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Use beta-specific installation: `pnpm add tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next`
  - CSS imports change from `@tailwind base;` to `@import "tailwindcss";`
  - Configuration uses CSS-first approach with `@theme` directive instead of `tailwind.config.js`
- **Fallback Plan:** If v4.0 beta causes issues, fallback to stable Tailwind CSS 3.4 with traditional configuration
- **Documentation:** https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta

#### ⚠️ Version Compatibility Notes
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Next.js 15.1:** Stable release, well-tested
- **Turborepo 2.3+:** Stable for monorepo orchestration
- **pnpm 9.0+:** Stable package manager
- **Monitoring:** Watch for any dependency conflicts during installation phase

## QA Results

### Review Summary
**Review Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Review Status:** Changes Required  

### Critical Logic Holes Identified

#### 1. Version Availability Issues
**CRITICAL:** The story specifies Next.js 15.4 and Tailwind CSS 4.0, but these versions have significant compatibility issues:

- **Next.js 15.4 Issue:** Based on Context7 documentation review, Next.js 15.4 appears to be a canary/alpha version. The stable releases are currently at v15.1.8. Using `npx create-next-app@15.4` in Task 1 may fail.
  - **Recommendation:** Use `npx create-next-app@latest` or specify `@15.1` for stability
  
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0 Issue:** Tailwind CSS 4.0 is currently in beta (v4.0-beta). The installation command and configuration approach are fundamentally different from v3.x:
  - v4.0 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` or `@tailwindcss/vite` plugins instead of traditional `tailwindcss` package
  - Configuration is CSS-first using `@theme` directive instead of `tailwind.config.js`
  - Installation: `npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next`

#### 2. Monorepo Structure Inconsistency
**Logic Gap:** The story mentions both Next.js app structure AND monorepo structure without clear delineation:
- Task 1 suggests standard Next.js initialization with App Router
- Task 3 suggests monorepo structure with `apps/web/`, `packages/shared/`, etc.
- These are conflicting approaches that need clarification

#### 3. Missing Dependency Specifications
**Incomplete:** Several critical dependencies mentioned in tech stack are not included in tasks:
- Turborepo configuration and installation
- pnpm workspace setup commands
- Sharp package (required for Next.js image optimization)
- TypeScript @types packages

#### 4. Configuration File Conflicts
**Inconsistency:** The story suggests multiple configuration approaches:
- Standard Next.js with `next.config.js`
- Monorepo with Turborepo's `turbo.json`
- Package manager workspace config with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- The execution order and interdependencies are unclear

### Acceptance Criteria Issues

#### AC-2 Tailwind CSS 4.0 Configuration
The specified configuration approach is outdated for v4.0:
- v4.0 doesn't use traditional PostCSS setup
- CSS import changes from `@tailwind base;` to `@import "tailwindcss";`
- Component initialization process is different

#### AC-3 Project Structure Ambiguity  
- Unclear if this is a monorepo or single app
- File structure references don't align with task execution order
- Missing clarification on whether to use Next.js defaults or custom monorepo structure

### Technical Compliance Review

#### ✅ Compliant Items:
- TypeScript with strict mode configuration
- ESLint and Prettier setup approach
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Git repository initialization
- Environment variable handling approach

#### ❌ Non-Compliant Items:
- Version specifications don't match actual available stable releases
- Configuration approach outdated for specified versions
- Missing critical dependencies for specified tech stack
- Monorepo vs single-app structure contradiction

### Security Review
**STATUS:** No security issues identified in current scope
- Standard Next.js security practices implied
- Environment variable handling follows best practices

### Performance Considerations
**STATUS:** Generally appropriate
- Next.js 15+ App Router for performance
- Turborepo for build optimization
- pnpm for efficient package management

### Required Changes

#### HIGH PRIORITY:
1. **Fix Version Specifications:**
   - Update to stable versions or clearly mark as beta/experimental
   - Provide proper installation commands for actual available versions

2. **Clarify Architecture:**
   - Define whether this is monorepo or single Next.js app
   - Provide clear execution path for chosen architecture

3. **Update Tailwind CSS 4.0 Tasks:**
   - Use correct v4.0 installation process
   - Update configuration approach for CSS-first theme
   - Include proper CSS import syntax

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1. Add missing dependency installations
2. Clarify configuration file creation order
3. Add Sharp package installation

#### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using stable versions (Next.js 15.1, Tailwind CSS 3.4) for initial setup
- If using beta versions, add explicit warnings and fallback plans
- Split into two stories: "Basic Setup" and "Monorepo Migration" if both architectures are needed
