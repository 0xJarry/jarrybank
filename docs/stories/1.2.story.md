Story 1.1 successfully implemented:
- Next.js 15.4.6 with TypeScript and App Router
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 beta with new @import syntax
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo
- Current page.tsx contains default Next.js template that needs to be replaced
[Source: Story 1.1 implementation]

### Component Specifications
**Header Component Structure:**
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/layout/header.tsx`
- Should follow component naming convention: PascalCase
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#component-organization]

**Footer Component Structure:**
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/layout/footer.tsx`
- Follow same conventions as header
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#component-organization]

**Page Structure:**
- Main landing page: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`
- Global styles: `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
- Layout wrapper: `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### Styling Requirements
**Tailwind CSS 4.0 Configuration:**
- Already configured with new @import syntax in globals.css
- Use @theme directive for custom theme values
- CSS-first configuration approach

- Components must be server-component compatible (Next.js App Router)
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
