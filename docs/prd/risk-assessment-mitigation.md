# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## Technical Risks

### High Probability, High Impact
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **External API Downtime** | Users can't access portfolio data | Multiple API sources, caching layer, graceful degradation |
| **Avalanche Network Issues** | Blockchain data unavailable | Multiple RPC providers, cached data fallback, status communication |
| **Performance Degradation** | Poor user experience, user churn | Performance monitoring, caching optimization, scalable architecture |

### Medium Probability, High Impact
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | User trust loss, potential exploits | Security audits, input validation, secure coding practices |
| **Wallet Integration Issues** | Users can't connect, blocked adoption | Comprehensive wallet testing, fallback options, clear error messages |
| **Data Accuracy Problems** | Incorrect portfolio values | Multi-source validation, data consistency checks, user reporting |

## Business Risks

### Market Risks
- **Competitive Pressure**: New portfolio tools launching
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on superior UX, Avalanche specialization, rapid feature development
- **Market Downturn**: Reduced crypto activity and user engagement
  - *Mitigation*: Build sticky features, focus on core utility, diversify user base

### Operational Risks
- **Team Scaling**: Difficulty hiring qualified Web3 developers
  - *Mitigation*: Competitive compensation, remote-first culture, community involvement
- **Cost Management**: Unexpected API or infrastructure costs
  - *Mitigation*: Usage monitoring, cost alerts, scalable pricing models

## Contingency Planning

### Service Disruption Response
1. **Immediate**: Activate status page, communicate with users via social media
2. **Short-term**: Deploy backup systems, implement workarounds
3. **Long-term**: Conduct post-mortem, implement preventive measures

### Competition Response
1. **Monitor**: Track competitive features and user feedback
2. **Differentiate**: Double down on unique value propositions
3. **Innovate**: Accelerate roadmap based on market gaps
